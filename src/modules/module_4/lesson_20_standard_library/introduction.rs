/// # Standard Library
///
/// Rust comes with a standard library which helps establish a set
/// of common types used by Rust libraries and programs. This way,
/// two libraries can work together smoothly because they both use
/// the same `String` type.
///
/// The common vocabulary types include:
///
/// - `Option` and `Result` types: used for optional values and error handling.
///
/// - `String`: the default string type used for owned data.
///
/// - `Vec`: a standard extensible vector.
///
/// - `HashMap`: a hash map type with a configurable hashing algorithm.
///
/// - `Box`: an owned pointer for heap-allocated data.
///
/// - `Rc`: a shared reference-counted pointer for heap-allocated data.
///
/// In fact, Rust contains several layers of the Standard Library:
/// `core`, `alloc` and `std`.
///
/// - `core` includes the most basic types and functions that donâ€™t depend on
///   **libc**, **allocator** or even the presence of an operating system.
///
/// - `alloc` includes types which require a global heap allocator, such as
///   `Vec`, `Box` and `Arc`.
///
/// - Embedded Rust applications often only use `core`, and sometimes `alloc`.
