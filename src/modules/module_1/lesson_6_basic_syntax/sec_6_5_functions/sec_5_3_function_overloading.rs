/// # Function Overloading
///
/// Overloading is not supported:
///
/// Each function has a single implementation:
///
/// - Always takes a fixed number of parameters.
///
/// - Always takes a single set of parameter types.
///
/// Default values are not supported:
///
/// - All call sites have the same number of arguments.
///
/// - Macros are sometimes used as an alternative.
///
/// However, function parameters can be generic:
///
/// - When using generics, the standard libraryâ€™s `Into<T>` can
///   provide a kind of limited polymorphism on argument types.
