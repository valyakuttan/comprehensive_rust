/// # Slices
/// 
/// A slice gives you a view into a larger collection:
/// 
/// - Slices borrow data from the sliced type.
///
/// - We create a slice by borrowing a and specifying the
///   starting and ending indexes in brackets.
/// 
/// - If the slice starts at index 0, Rust’s range syntax allows
///   us to drop the starting index, meaning that
///   `&a[0..a.len()]` and `&a[..a.len()]` are identical.
/// 
/// - The same is true for the last index, so `&a[2..a.len()]`
///   and `&a[2..]` are identical.
/// 
/// - To easily create a slice of the full array, we can therefore
///   use `&a[..]`.
/// 
/// - `s` is a reference to a slice of `i32`s. Notice that the type of
///   `s (&[i32])` no longer mentions the array length. This allows
///   us to perform computation on slices of different sizes.
/// 
/// - Slices always borrow from another object. In this example, `a` has
///   to remain ‘alive’ (in scope) for at least as long as our slice. 
/// 
/// -

    // a[3] = 25; // can't mutate object while it is borrowd by s
