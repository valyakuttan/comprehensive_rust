/// # Memory Management
///
/// Traditionally, languages have fallen into two broad categories:
///
/// - Full control via manual memory management: C, C++, Pascal, $\ldots$
///
/// - Full safety via automatic memory management at runtime: Java, Python,
///   Go, Haskell, $\ldots$
///
/// Rust offers a new mix:
///
/// ```
/// Full control and safety via compile time enforcement of correct memory management.
/// ```
///
/// It does this with an explicit ownership concept.
