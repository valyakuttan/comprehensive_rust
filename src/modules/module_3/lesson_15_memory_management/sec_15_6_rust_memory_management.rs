/// # Memory Management in Rust
/// 
/// Memory management in Rust is a mix:
/// 
/// - Safe and correct like Java, but without a garbage collector.
/// 
/// - Scope-based like C++, but the compiler enforces full adherence.
/// 
/// - A Rust user can choose the right abstraction for the situation,
///   some even have no cost at runtime like C.
/// 
/// Rust achieves this by modeling ownership explicitly.
/// 
/// - This is usually handled in Rust by RAII wrapper types such as
///   `Box`, `Vec`, `Rc`, or `Arc`. These encapsulate ownership and
///   memory allocation via various means, and prevent the potential
///   errors in C.
/// 
/// - The `Drop` trait is the Rust equivalent of destructor.
