/// # Match Guards
/// 
/// When matching, you can add a guard to a pattern. This is an
/// arbitrary Boolean expression which will be executed if the
/// pattern matches:
/// 
/// - Match guards as a separate syntax feature are important and
///   necessary when we wish to concisely express more complex ideas
///   than patterns alone would allow.
/// 
/// - They are not the same as separate `if` expression inside of the
///   match arm. An `if` expression inside of the branch block
///   (after `=>`) happens after the match arm is selected. Failing the
///   `if` condition inside of that block wonâ€™t result in other arms of
///   the original match expression being considered.
/// 
/// - You can use the variables defined in the pattern in your `if` expression.
/// 
/// - The condition defined in the guard applies to every expression in a
///   pattern with an `|`.
///
