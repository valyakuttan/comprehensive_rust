/// # Enums
/// 
/// The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type which has a
/// few different variants:
/// 
/// - Enumerations allow you to collect a set of values under one type
/// 
/// - The `enum` type `CoinFlip` has two variants `Heads`
///   and `Tails`.
/// 
/// ## Comparison of Structs and Enums: 
/// 
/// - In both, you can have a simple version without fields
///   (unit struct) or one with different types of fields (variant payloads).
/// 
/// - In both, associated functions are defined within an `impl` block.
/// 
/// - You could even implement the different variants of an enum with
///   separate structs but then they wouldnâ€™t be the same type as they
///   would if they were all defined in an `enum`.
