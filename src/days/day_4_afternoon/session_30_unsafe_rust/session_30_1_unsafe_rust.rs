/// # 30.1 Unsafe rust
///
/// Unsafe code is usually small and isolated, and its correctness should be
/// carefully documented. It is usually wrapped in a safe abstraction layer.
///
/// Unsafe Rust gives you access to five new capabilities:
///
/// - Dereference raw pointers.
///
/// - Access or modify mutable static variables.
///
/// - Access `union` fields.
///
/// - Call `unsafe` functions, including `extern` functions.
///
/// - Implement `unsafe` traits.
///
