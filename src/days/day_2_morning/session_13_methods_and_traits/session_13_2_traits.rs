/// # 13.2 Traits
///
/// Rust lets you abstract over types with traits. Theyâ€™re similar to
/// interfaces:
///
/// - A trait defines a number of methods that types must have in order
///   to implement the trait.
///
/// - Traits are implemented in an `impl <trait> for <type> { .. }` block.
///
/// - Traits may specify pre-implemented (provided) methods and methods
///   that users are required to implement themselves. Provided methods
///   can rely on required methods. In this case, greet is provided, and
///   relies on talk.
///

struct Dog {
    name: String,

    fn talk(&self) -> String;
}

impl Pet for Dog {
    fn talk(&self) -> String {
        format!("Woof, my name is {}!", self.name)
    }
}

impl Pet for Cat {
    fn talk(&self) -> String {
        String::from("Miau!")

        name: String::from("Fido"),
