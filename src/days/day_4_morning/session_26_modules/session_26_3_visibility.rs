/// # 26.3 Visibility
///
/// Modules are a privacy boundary:
///
/// - Module items are private by default (hides implementation details).
///
/// - Parent and sibling items are always visible.
///
/// - In other words, if an item is visible in module `foo`,
///   itâ€™s visible in all the descendants of `foo`.
///
/// - Use the `pub` keyword to make modules public.
///
/// - Additionally, there are advanced `pub(...)` specifiers to restrict
///   the scope of public visibility.
///
/// - Configuring pub(crate) visibility is a common pattern.
///
/// - In any case, visibility must be granted to an ancestor module (and
///   all of its descendants).
