/// # 27.3 Useful Crates
/// 
/// Rust comes with only basic support for writing tests.
/// 
/// Here are some additional crates which we recommend for writing tests:
/// 
/// - `googletest`: Comprehensive test assertion library in the tradition
///   of GoogleTest for C++.
/// 
/// - `proptest`: Property-based testing for Rust.
/// 
/// - `rstest`: Support for fixtures and parameterised tests.
